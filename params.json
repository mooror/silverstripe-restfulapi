Here you can find extra Documentation and tutorials for the [silverstripe-restfulapi module created by colymba](https://github.com/colymba/silverstripe-restfulapi).So what are you waiting for? [Go learn some stuff!](https://mooror.github.io/silverstripe-restfulapi/website/documentation/index.html)\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nThis module implements a RESTful API for read/write access to your SilverStripe Models. It comes bundled with a default Token Authenticator, Query Handler and JSON Serializers, and can be extended to your need and to return XML or other content type via custom components.\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\nThough I do manage this project website and a fork of the silverstripe-restfulapi repository, I am not in fact the original creator nor am I apart of the organization/team that created it. The purpose of this site is to give extra information (like [API Docs](https://mooror.github.io/silverstripe-restfulapi/website/)) and tutorials that were not included in the original project. So please make sure to go and support the [official github repository for this project](https://github.com/colymba/silverstripe-restfulapi)\r\n\r\n# License (BSD Simplified)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, Thierry Francois (colymba)\r\n\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n * Neither the name of Thierry Francois, colymba nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n \r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
